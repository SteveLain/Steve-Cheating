    <h3 class="title">Lost in the moment </h3>
    <h2 class="subp">[Verse 1]
Sitting in that quiet place, just you and me,
Snacks are on the table, but you're all I see.
Talking for hours, like time stood still,
Every word you say, baby, gives me chills.
<br> 
[Pre-Chorus]
You sat on my lap, wrapped up so tight,
Your touch, your warmth, feels so right.
Fingers tracing, love in the air,
In that moment, nothing else was there.
<br> 
[Chorus]
Oh baby, when you kiss me, I lose my mind,
Like a dream so real, like the stars aligned.
Deeper and deeper, I fall into you,
With every touch, there's nothing I'd rather do.
<br> 
[Verse 2]
Your soft skin, like the calmest tide,
Pulling me closer, no need to hide.
The way you hold me, the way you breathe,
Got me thinking, you’re all I need.
<br> 
[Pre-Chorus]
You sat on my lap, wrapped up so tight,
Your touch, your warmth, feels so right.
Fingers tracing, love in the air,
In that moment, nothing else was there.
<br> 
[Chorus]
Oh baby, when you kiss me, I lose my mind,
Like a dream so real, like the stars aligned.
Deeper and deeper, I fall into you,
With every touch, there's nothing I'd rather do.
<br> 
[Bridge]
Your hands on me, your lips so sweet,
Loving you feels like the perfect dream.
Heartbeat racing, love taking flight,
Lost in you, lost in the night.
<br> 
[Outro]
Hold me closer, don’t let go,
With you, love’s the only thing I know.
Every touch, every kiss, every whispered tone,
You are my world, my heart, my home.</h2>
